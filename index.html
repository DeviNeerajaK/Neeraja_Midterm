				Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely 
				acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. 
				Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made 
				important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. 
				Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics.
				His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has
				been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".[9] His work is also known for its 
				influence on the philosophy of science.[10][11] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in 
				Physics "for hiss services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of 
				the law of the photoelectric effect",[12] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. 
				His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with 
				"genius". Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his 
				honor.

				In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein 
				published four groundbreaking papers.[15] These outlined the theory of the photoelectric 
				effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated 
				mass–energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could 
				no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to 
				develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational 
				fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of 
				gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure 
				of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and 
				quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. 
				He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, 
				which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.</b>

				After graduating from the Zurich Polytechnic in 1900, Einstein wanted to work as a 
				teacher at a university. He hoped to gain a professorship at a school where he could 
				teach, but still have time work on his theories. This wasn't to be the case, however, 
				as he struggled for two years to find a teaching position. Eventually, he landed a job 
				examining patent applications. Einstein worked at the patent office for seven years, 
				spending what free time he could muster reading scientific papers and working on his own 
				theories. Even after he published four groundbreaking scientific papers in 1905 
				(see Einstein's Miracle Year) and earned his doctorate, he still struggled to find a 
				job teaching. Finally, in 1908, he was hired as a lecturer at the University of Bern.

				As Einstein's fame as a theoretical physicist grew, so did his opportunities in the 
				academic arena. A year after becoming a lecturer at the University of Bern, he was 
				appointed to the position of associate professor of physics at the University of Zurich.
				He then became a full professor at the University of Prague in 1911 and, a year later, 
				returned to Zurich as a full professor. His academic life reached its peak when he became
				a professor at the University of Berlin and a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.
				At the University of Berlin, Einstein earned the salary of a professor without any teaching
				duties. This allowed him to focus on research and developing new theories full time. 
				He also served as the Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics. Einstein would 
				remain at the University of Berlin until the early 1930s.

					Albert Einstein’s hobbies were sailing, reading and playing the violin and piano. 
					He also wrote travel journals that are now held in the Albert Einstein Archives in 
					Jerusalem.
					Einstein owned several sailboats in his lifetime. He kept one in Caputh, Germany, 
					that was seized along with his cottage in 1933 when the Nazis took power. When he 
					lived in the United States, he owned a sailboat called Tinnef.Einstein enjoyed 
					reading and is quoted as saying that “Traktat” by David Humes had a big influence 
					on him. He enjoyed classics, such as Don Quijote by Cervantes Saavedra and books 
					with a scientific bent, including “Energy and Matter” by Ludwig Büchners and Aaron 
					Bernstein’s “Natural-Scientific Popular Books.” He also read books by the 
					philosophers Spinoza and Schopenhauer.

					Einstein began taking violin lessons at an early age, discovering Mozart at age 13. 
					He was known to play for friends, in small gatherings or with his friend, fellow 
					physicist Max Planck. Einstein enjoyed playing the violin, although opinions differ 
					on his talent level. According to a book by Ze’ev Rosenkranz, Einstein was modest 
					about his ability but still enjoyed playing. As he became older, he switched to piano
					because he no longer liked the way he played violin. Aside from Mozart, his favorite 
					composers were Bach, Vivaldi, Corelli and Schubert. He was quoted as saying that he 
					would probably have become a musician if he had not become a physicist.
